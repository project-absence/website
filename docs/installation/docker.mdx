description: Install Project Absence with Docker or Docker Compose

## Docker

You can run the tool from the published [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/kkrypt0nn/project-absence) using

```bash
docker run -v ~/.absence:/root/.absence -it kkrypt0nn/project-absence
```

By using `-v ~/.absence:/root/.absence` it will set up a volume so that you can use your `config.toml` file, that way your `config.toml` is used and the results are saved properly for you to view them.

## Docker Compose

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file that can be used as well, in case you need it:

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  project-absence:
    image: kkrypt0nn/project-absence:latest
    volumes:
      - ${HOME}/.absence:/root/.absence
```

You can then run it with

```bash
docker-compose run project-absence
```

or use it along with other services and use `docker-compose up`.

Here as well, it is ideal to specify a volume so that your `config.toml` is used and so that the results are saved properly for you to view them.
