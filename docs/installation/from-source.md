description: Install Project Absence by building it from source
---

You need to have [Rust](https://rustup.rs) installed. After cloning this repository you can build it using:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

:::note

On **Linux** systems, you have to install the following packages if you want to use the `--clipboard/-C` CLI argument:

- `libxcb1-dev`
- `libxcb-render0-dev`
- `libxcb-shape0-dev`
- `libxcb-xfixes0-dev`

They are required for the [`clipboard`](https://crates.io/crates/clipboard) crate to work properly. The usage of the crate may be put behind a feature in the future so that you are not forced to install these packages.
